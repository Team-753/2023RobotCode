# 2023RobotCode

Team 753's 2023 Robot Code for the FIRST FRC game: Charged Up.

Current Features are:

- Command-based programming for easy code structuring
- Velocity Driven Teleop Swerve Drive
- Full autonomous path following with events ~ WIP
- and much more to come.

If you are here to try and get something out of this code, I'd love to sit down with you for 2 straight days to talk it over.
Cheers,
Joe
