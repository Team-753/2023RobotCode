# 2023RobotCode

Team 753's 2023 Robot Code for the FIRST FRC game: Charged Up.

Current Features are:

- Command-based programming for easy code structuring
- PID-Aligned, Velocity Driven Teleop Swerve Drive
- Full autonomous path following functionality with command support
- Dynamic button macros automating large parts of the game
- Multi-vision camera support for heightened pose estimation

If you are here to try and get something out of this code, I'd love to sit down with you for 2 straight days to talk it over.
Cheers,
Joe
